# Monitoring

To enable monitoring as part of a scheduled Databricks workflow, please update all the TODOs in the [monitoring resource file](../resources/monitoring-resource.yml), and refer to
[{{template `project_name_alphanumeric_underscore` .}}/resources/README.md](../resources/README.md). The implementation supports monitoring of batch inference tables directly.
For real time inference tables, unpacking is required before monitoring can be attached.
